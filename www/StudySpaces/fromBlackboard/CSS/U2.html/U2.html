<h3>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004)</h3>
<blockquote> On Atomic Bomb, they're not auditioning anymore. 
This is grandiose music from grandiose men, sweatlessly confident in the execution of 
their duties. Hardly any of the eleven songs break the five-minute mark or stray from the 
punchy formula of All That You Can't Leave Behind. They've gotten over their midcareer 
anxiety about whether they're cool enough. Now, they just hand it to the Edge and 
let it rip.

<h3>The Joshua Tree (1987)</h3>
<blockquote> The Joshua Tree is U2's most varied, subtle and accessible album, although 
it doesn't contain any sure-fire smash hits. But in its musical toughness and 
strong-willed spirituality, the album lives up to its namesake: a hardy, twisted tree 
that grows in the rocky deserts of the American Southwest. A Mormon legend claims that 
their early settlers called the Joshua tree "the praying plant" and thought its gnarled 
branches suggested the Old Testament prophet Joshua pointing the way to the Promised Land.
 The title befits a record that concerns itself with resilience in the face of utter 
 social and political desolation, a record steeped in religious imagery.
