<h3 class="album">Ceremonials (2011)</h3>
<blockquote class="quote"> Florence and the Machine's second album is as dark, robust and 
romantic as ever, but a revving 18-wheeler is no longer the apt metaphor for Welch's voice. 
Listen to her hooting and growling on "Only If for a Night," a ballad somewhere between 
classic soul and midnight-on-the-moors English art rock. Listen to "Shake It Out," a 
treatise on heartbreak and spiritual rebirth. "I am done with my graceless heart/So 
tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart," she cries, over guitars and keyboards that
heave and chime. This is the sound of a human turbine – a wind machine.

<h3 class="album">Lungs (2009)</h3>
<blockquote class="quote"> [B]y nonchalantly walking the precarious tightrope between 
commercial appeal and that most nebulous of entities, critical approval, Welch has 
ensured this ballsy debut album delivers on both counts. ‘Lungs’ is rammed with silky soul, 
spiky ballads, raw blues and unashamedly big pop songs, all spiced with the singer’s 
trademark gothic humour and breath-stealing baritone.
