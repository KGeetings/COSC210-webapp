Working with large blocks of text in a file opens up a whole new range of
possibilities for interesting programs. The following program solves Jumble
puzzles, which ask the solver to figure out an unknown word given a scrambled
set of its letters.

One of the difficulties in solving this problem is that long words have so many
different reorderings, called permutations. The strategy employed here is to
create a unique signature for each word, so that a word has the same signature
as all of its permutations. This program also finds anagrams, since typing
an unscrambled word will find all of it anagrams.
