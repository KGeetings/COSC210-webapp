<h1>The Yellow Warbler</h1>
<p>The <strong>yellow warbler</strong> (<i>Setophaga petechia</i>, formerly <i>Dendroica petechia</i>) 
<img src="images/yellow warbler.jpg" alt="male yellow warbler image" title="Male Yellow Warbler">is a New World 
warbler species. Warblers are the most widespread species in the diverse genus <i>Setophaga</i>, 
breeding in almost the whole of North America and down to northern South America.

<p>Other than in male breeding plumage and body size, all warbler subspecies are very similar. 
Winter, female and immature birds all have similarly greenish-yellow uppersides and are a 
duller yellow below. Young males soon acquire breast and, where appropriate, head coloration. 
Females are somewhat duller, most notably on the head. In all, the remiges and rectrices 
are blackish olive with yellow edges, sometimes appearing as an indistinct wing-band on 
the former. The eyes and the short thin beak are dark, while the feet are lighter or darker 
olive-buff.<cite> Wikipedia</cite></p>
