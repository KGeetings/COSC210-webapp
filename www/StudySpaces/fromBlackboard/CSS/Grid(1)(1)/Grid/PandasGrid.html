    <h2>Pandas in Wolong</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="nine columns">
		<p>The Wolong National Nature Preserve, in the Sichuan Province of 
		China, is home to more than 150 giant pandas. It's one of the key sites 
		for panda breeding research, and 66 cubs have been born at Wolong since 
		it was established in 1980. Pandas are an endangered species, with 
		between 1500 and 3000 living in the wild, and less than 300 in captivity
		 (research centers and zoos).</p>

		<p>The Wolong Nature Reserve covers around 200,000 hectares (772 square 
		miles) in the Ming Shan mountain range, in the ABA Tibetan Autonomous 
		Region, near the Tibetan Plateau. Elevations in the reserve range from 
		1555 to 4600 meters (4,000 to 11,000 ft).</p>
		<p>The Wolong Panda Center was devestated during the May 2008 
		earthquake, and the main road to the center was impassable after the 
		earthquake. Five staff members and one captive panda died in the 
		earthquake. The pandas at the center were temporarily relocated to 
		another panda center in China, until a rebuilt Wolong Panda Center 
		opened in 2012, in another area of the reserve. The new center 
		integrates scientific research with captive breeding and also creates 
		opportunities for introducing pandas into the wild.</p>
